# 🎄 Advent of Code in Go 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code in GO**! 🐹✨  
This repo is my holiday coding playground, filled with festive problem-solving and Go magic.

## 🎁 What's Inside
- **Daily Challenges**: Solutions for each day are in `2024/solutions/`.
- **Testing the Season**: Includes tests for some days (but not all) to verify the magic. 🎅
- **Utility Workshop**: Reusable helpers in the `utils` package.

## ❄️ How to Use

### 🎅 Running a Day
1. Open `2024/main.go` and define the day to run.
2. Run the solution with `make run`.

### 🧪 Running Tests
- Run all tests with `make test`.
- Test a specific day (e.g., Day 4) with `make test4`.

*Note: Not all days have tests. The elves are working on it!*

## 🐹 Why Go?
Because nothing says “holiday spirit” like picking up a new language while chasing gold stars! 🌟
